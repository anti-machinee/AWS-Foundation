# Introduction
- This project is "Create an AutoML job to fine-tune text generation models using the API"
- For concept learning purpose, the coding is not be completed

# AWS guide
- Choose pre-trained model
- Create instruction datasets
- Store datasets in S3
- Create access for related AWS services such as S3, JumpStart and SageMaker

## Models
- Based on use case, choose a pre-trained model
## Instruction datasets
- Support types
- Limitations of rows and context length
## Hyperparameters 
- For training purposes
## Metrics
- NLP metrics
## Model deployment
- Use SageMaker APIs
- Request format for LLMs
